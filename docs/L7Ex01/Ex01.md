# Lab 7: Extend Microsoft 365 Copilot with Microsoft Copilot Studio

The leadership of Contoso is very happy with the progress of their Copilot for Microsoft 365 journey. Now that they have SharePoint Advanced Management enhancing their M365 collaboration capabilities, they want to focus on one last step: creating their own conversational plugin to assist Contoso sellers. 

You will now use Microsoft Copilot Studio to retrieve data on Microsoft Technology Job Opportunities and make it available through Copilot for Microsoft 365 as a plug in.
