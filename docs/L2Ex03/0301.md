{: .important }
> The **Allow users to access the feedback portal** policy is a cloud policy. This policy isn't defined in ADMX and doesn't have a corresponding registry key available to set the policy. You should create a cloud policy to enforce it. This is a cloud policy because the feedback portal is a web application that makes a call to the cloud policy service, (which is also a web application), requesting the policies for the person who signs in. If this policy is configured, the feedback portal will receive the configured policy value in the response from the cloud policy service.
