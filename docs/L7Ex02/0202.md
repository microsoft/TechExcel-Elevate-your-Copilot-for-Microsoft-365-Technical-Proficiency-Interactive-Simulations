# Task 2.2: Turn on Developer Mode in Copilot in Teams

You can use *developer mode* for **M365 Chat** while testing your plugin to verify if and how the orchestrator selected your plugin for use in response to a given prompt. From *M365 Chat*, you can enable developer mode by typing **-developer on** (or **-developer off** to disable). 

 

1. In the Teams Copilot prompt, enter **-developer on**.
