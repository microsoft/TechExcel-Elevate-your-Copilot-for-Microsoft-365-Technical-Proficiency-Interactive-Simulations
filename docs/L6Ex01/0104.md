    | Policy | Description |
    |:---------|:---------|
    | Set Up Policies:   | Utilize the policy templates available in the App Governance UI to create policies based on user and data access, permissions, and certification. You can create custom app policies using the 16 predicates provided.   |
    | Monitor Apps:   | Ensure that the apps you want to govern are registered in Azure Active Directory, have OAuth capability, and use the Graph API, as these criteria are necessary for the apps to appear in the overview and apps pages during policy creation.   |
    | Apply Conditional Access Policies:   | Use Microsoft Entra authentication context to enforce more stringent access conditions when users access SharePoint sites. Authentication contexts can be directly applied to sites or used with sensitivity labels to connect Microsoft Entra Conditional Access policies to labeled sites.   |
    | Secure Document Libraries:   | If SharePoint is enabled for sensitivity labels, configure a default label for document libraries to ensure the security of documents stored within.   |
    | Restrict OneDrive Access:   | Limit OneDrive access to members of a specific security group if needed. This can prevent users outside these security groups from accessing their own OneDrive or any shared OneDrive content, even if they are licensed for it.   |
    | License Management:  | Ensure that you have SharePoint Advanced Management licenses for all employees who are in scope of or may benefit from Data Access Governance   |
