# Task 1.1: Search the audit log for Copilot interactions in Microsoft Purview

When auditing Copilot interactions, Microsoft Purview Audit captures detailed events including user interactions with Copilot, the Microsoft 365 service where the activity occurred, and references to any accessed files stored in Microsoft 365. If these files have sensitivity labels, this information is also recorded. To search for these interactions with your M365 license, follow these steps:

1. Sign into the **[Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft Purview compliance portal")**.

1. If prompted, in the **Welcome to the new Microsoft Purview portal** dialog box, select the **I agree to the terms of data flow disclosure, and Privacy Statements** checkbox, and then select **Try now**.

1. Select the **Audit** solution card.  
    - If the Audit solution card isn't displayed, select **View all solutions** and then select **Audit** from the **Core** section.
   
1. Configure your search on the **Search** tab.  
    - Set the **Start date** and **End date** for your search.

> ## Limitations and considerations for auditing Copilot interactions
>
When implementing compliance management solutions for Copilot in Microsoft 365, it's important to be aware of the limitations and considerations:
>
- **Scope of auditing**: Auditing captures the occurrence of Copilot activities, such as search events, but doesn't record the actual user prompts or responses. For detailed interaction data, eDiscovery tools should be used.
>
- **Admin-related changes exclusion**: Changes related to Copilot administration, such as configuration adjustments, aren't currently captured in the auditing logs.
>
- **Device Identity Information**: Device identity information, which can be important for comprehensive auditing, isn't included in the audit details for Copilot activities.
>
**Application-specific limitations:**
>
- **Copilot in Teams**: When transcripts are turned off, auditing capabilities for Copilot interactions aren't supported. Actions involving referencing transcripts aren't captured in the audit logs.
>
- **Identification of Source App**: The source of Copilot interactions is identified by the app name in the audit logs, such as Copilot in Word or Copilot in Teams.
