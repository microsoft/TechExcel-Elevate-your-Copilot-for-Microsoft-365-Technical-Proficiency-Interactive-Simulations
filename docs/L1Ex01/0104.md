> ## Copilot in Windows: work and school accounts.
>
> Copilot in Windows uses Microsoft Copilot, but if you're signed into your Windows device with a work or school account, your IT administrator might have policies that change or disable Copilot in Windows. You might see Copilot in Windows using the following chat providers instead of Microsoft Copilot:
> - Microsoft Copilot with commercial data protection (formerly known as Bing Chat Enterprise)
> - Microsoft Copilot with Graph-grounded chat (formerly known as Microsoft 365 Chat) 
>
When you're using Copilot with commercial data protection, chat history isn't available, and the chat pane displays the following message: Your personal and company data are protected in this chat. 
>
Students typically don't have access to Copilot in Windows, but faculty members and higher education students over 18 years of age may have access to Copilot with commercial data protection.
