Reviewers added here are the reviewers that you can choose from when escalating an alert in the investigation and remediation workflow. When reviewers are added to a policy, they automatically receive an email message that notifies them of the assignment to the policy and provides links to information about the review process.

1. Choose a limited condition field, usually a sensitive info type or keyword dictionary to apply to the policy.

   For example **Add condition** > **Message contains any of these words** > **Social Security Number**.
